# Xray-object-detection-with-ssd_mobilenet_v2

In this project, ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_2 is used but depending on application requirements, other models can also be fine tuned. 

Nowadays millions of people use public transport such as airlines and subways. One of the important aspect of this transport is security inspection such as baggage screening that has become critical role in clearance process and security risk such as terrorism. This security inspection has become substantially inconvenient due to usage of transportation by large population and it can be addressed using object detection system. However there are multiple challenges in such object detection system like imbalance dataset and overlapping images.
